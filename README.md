Description might follow some day, but I will implement that Emu into a bigger multi-system Emulator.
It works, you can run some Rom-Files that are included and there's a Guide Section in the Menu, that helps you navigate the Apple I.
It boots into WozMon but you can also start Basic by typing E000R.
It has some cool unique features, like Network Support, virtual Cartridges, and you can Import Basic Code or Dump the RAM into a Hex-File.
Decimal Mode is not working correctly (but was rarely used anyways). Tape Drive Emulation also isnt working. It runs in realistic speed but isnt 100% cycle accurate.

Code has MIT License, you can import it into Unity and do whatever you want with it.
